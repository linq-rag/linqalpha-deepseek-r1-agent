# Linq-alpha's DeepSeek Agent

## Overview
This repository showcases an **iterative function-calling agent** powered by a “reasoning model.” The agent takes a user query, thinks through possible solutions, calls functions (such as web search) to gather information, and iterates until it arrives at a final answer. The approach combines a formal output schema (using Pydantic) with robust reasoning steps to explain how the agent arrived at its solution.

## What Is an Agent?
An **agent** in this context is a narrowly defined system that:
1. **Receives a user’s query or goal** (e.g., “Find current news about X”).
2. **Uses a reasoning loop** to break down the request, figure out what data or operations are needed, and decide whether additional function calls are required.
3. **Executes function calls** (like `search_google`) to gather real-world information or perform operations.
4. **Iteratively refines** the partial (intermediate) answer until it’s confident in a final result.

By returning a structured JSON response (rather than a single text string), the agent can keep track of:
- Whether to continue iterating (`keep_going`)
- Which functions to call (`function_calls`)
- Intermediate progress (`answer`)
- Its summarizing logic of **why** it made certain decisions (`summary_reasoning`)

## Why a Reasoning Model for Function-Calling?
In human problem-solving, **step-by-step reasoning** helps identify blind spots, gather new information, and refine solutions. Applying this to language models:

1. **Transparency**: The chain-of-thought or “reasoning trace” helps developers (and sometimes end users) understand *why* a model produced a certain output.
2. **Debugging & Reliability**: If the model outputs an invalid or incomplete result, we can review the reasoning trace to identify where the logic went astray—then correct it.
3. **Human-Like Problem Solving**: Much like people do “deliberate practice,” the model iterates, tests partial solutions, and adjusts accordingly.

This approach aligns with interpretability research, such as [Anthropic’s exploration of reasoning structures](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model). Their findings suggest that “chain-of-thought” style reasoning can increase a model’s transparency and verifiability.

## The Benefit of Iterative Function Calls
During each iteration, the agent might realize it needs more data or that an error occurred. By capturing errors as *input back to the model*:
- The agent can **self-correct** (akin to “self-healing”), attempting new function calls or re-checking logic.
- It can refine arguments to the function or prompt based on the errors encountered (similar to debugging code).

For instance:
1. The agent calls `search_google` with certain parameters.
2. If the results are empty or return an error, that error is fed back into the agent’s reasoning step.
3. The agent then modifies the search query (e.g., changes date range or search terms) and tries again until it’s satisfied.

This iterative “Wolverine-style” self-healing loop makes the agent robust against partial failures or incomplete data.
